# Hanami 2 Application Template

If you’ve been interested in exploring or testing our in-progress Hanami 2 work,
this application template can help you start! [Learn more in my announcement
post][ann].

[ann]: https://timriley.info/writing/2020/05/07/sharing-my-hanami-2-application-template/

To create an application from this template, click the “Use this template”
button above.

Then, once you’ve cloned your new repository, run:

```sh
./bin/install name_of_your_app
```

This will rename all instances of `AppPrototype` within
(in all its case variations) to the name of your application.

Then rename the `.env-example` file to `.env`, and update the values as necessary.

See [README.app.md](README.app.md) for details of the generated application.
